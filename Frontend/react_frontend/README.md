This app is a one stop shop of any kind of Mathematical Solution regardless of the complexity level. According to the current data, there is no app or online service that is as advance as this app in terms of handling all the domains of Mathematics and in handling the complexity level. This app is three times advance than the scientific calculators that we get in the market.

This app covers: Matrices and Vectors, Arithmetic and Trigonometry, Calculus (Differentiation and Integration), Statistics, Algebra, Complex numbers and a bonus functionality called ‘Expression Cracker’ where you can simply type in any Mathematical Expression to find the end result of that expression.
